      Various stateless queries against Ogmios v6 instance. Please note that ogmios follows JSON-RPC 2.0 method, the example spec on koios.rest is *ONLY* for `queryNetwork/tip`,
      but all the methods listed below are all accepted. Instead of duplicating specs, we would refer you directly to Ogmios documentation [here](https://ogmios.dev/api) for complete specs.

        Note that for queries to be stateless across instances on the globe, we cannot acquire local state as successive calls will be across different instances. Additionally, `queryLedgerState/utxo` method is removed to avoid DDoS impacts.
        Thus, we only expose the following methods from monitoring servers, instance providers can expose entire ogmios endpoints if desirable:
